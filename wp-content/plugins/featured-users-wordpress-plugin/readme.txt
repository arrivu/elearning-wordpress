Allows the administrator make users featured. All it does is give the user a custom meta field called `jsfeatured_user`.

== Description ==

While working on a custom WordPress theme we needed the ability to feature users / authors. So we created this plugin which allows the administrator to easily star (featured) users. Then using a custom query in the theme we where able to get only the featured users by only retrieving users with the custom user meta &quot;jsfeatured_user&quot;. The plugin dosent make any chanages to your current theme it only does the following:

1. Adds a featured column in the Users panel of the WordPress Admin
2. When a user is featured the plugin adds or updates the custom filed &quot;jsfeatured_user&quot; and sets the value to yes.

Feel free to use and include in your WordPress Installs, please think of us if you need a custom theme or plugin developed!!
